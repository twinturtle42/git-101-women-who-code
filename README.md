# Welcome to Git 101 workshop!

### Challenges 💪
Solve the following challenges with your workshop buddy (pair programming).

**Cheatsheet** for [Mac & Linux Users](http://bit.ly/gitgithubmac).<br/> **Cheatsheet** for [Windows Users](http://bit.ly/gitgithubwindows)

<br/>
<br/>

| Challenge1| Command Line Basics (Use your Cheatsheet)|
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Open your terminal 
| 2 | Create a new folder on your Desktop using your command line.
| 3 | Find the command to change to that folder/directory
| 4 | Inside you new directory, create a new file called index.html
| 5 | Initialize git for that directory
| 6 | On your Desktop, drag that file in your text/code editor. Then write some stuff in that file, close it and save the file (If you need to download a text Editor >> [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)).
| 7 | Which Git command do you use to review what changed in the HTML? Make a new commit to explain what changed. 
| 8 | Create a new branch and jump onto that branch. How do you know how many branches there are in the project? How do you know which branch you are on?
| 9 | Now, `git checkout` to your master branch and then merge your branch to the master branch

| Challenge2| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Open your terminal.
| 2 | Make sure your current directory is on desktop.
| 3 | Go to https://github.com/twinturtle42/git-github-workshop
| 4 | **Fork** the repositiory (so that you are the Master of that repository)  >> <img width="640" alt="Go4Tech" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/GitHub_Fork_Button.png" width="250">
| 5 | `git clone` your new repository onto your Desktop

| Challenge3| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Create a new branch and change to that branch. 
| 2 | Update the HTML file with your name and save it.
| 3 | To save the new version, first `git add` the updated HTML file. Then the changes on that branch with a message: `git commit -m "a message"` 
| 5 | Run `git remote -v` so that you see what remote repository is linked to your project?
| 6 | Finally, git push your branch to GitHub. (Make sure to push the branch using `git push origin branch-name`) 
| 7 | Create a pull request and merge your branch on Github

| Challenge4| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Go to back to the repository page on and clone: https://github.com/twinturtle42/git-github-workshop
| 2 | Come and give us your Github Username so that I can add you as a collaborator
| 3 | Using a branch, add your name to the index.html file and push that branch to Github
| 4 | Open a Pull Request for us to review.
| 5 | If your Pull Request got accepted, your changes are added to the codebase and available [here](https://allthatjoy.github.io/git-101-women-who-code/)

**Before Getting started with the Challenges**

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | In your terminal, run the command: `git version`. If Git is not installed, you can find the install file [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
| 2 | Set your username and email on git. To set username, run `git config --global user.name “your name”`. To run your email : `git config --global user.email “your email”`
| 3 | To make your terminal more user-friendly, **install oh-my-zsh**
|   | **For Mac & Linux Users**: The installations instructions are [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). You can also just run this command in your terminal: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
|   |**b) For Windows 10 Users**: You can find installations instructions [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-windows10/), but the process is much much longer, so it is recommended that you do this at home.
